# COSC343 Assignment2

Using a genetic algorithm (involving tournament selection, a fitness function, mutations, and elitism), to evolve a population of agents to beat a random player.
Structure uses an array of 10 floats, organised in gene pairs, to assign for/against behaviors to each agent. 
Evolves over time to find out what percept senses to move towards or away from, eventually learning how to consistently win the game.
  Aim of game: to have a larger population the enemy at the final 100th turn.
